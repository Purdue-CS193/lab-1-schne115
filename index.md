# Julia Schneider's first CS193 Lab
- it shows how Purdue is committed to help students with their futures by not only preparing them for a job, but preparing freshman for the next four years and tools they need for education

- I like using tools before I need to use them for more challenging courses

- I like getting advice from students who were in my position in the last few years

- it makes me more confident in my ability to keep up with the computer science major and the technologies we will use

- I get to meet people who are also computer science majors :)
